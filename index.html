    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population. <br />
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. <br />
    Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. <br />
    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. <br />
